# The Go Programming Language

This is some code I've written while reading [The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/).
Normally I would keep this repository more organized, but I'm pushing the code
here only so I can share it between computers. Thus, don't expect much
structure â€“ just random bits of code, loosely organized by chapter names.
