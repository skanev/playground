# The Go Programming Language

This is some code I've written while reading [The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/).
I'm trying to solve all exercises one by one. I initially decided not to do
the exercises of the book, but they just turned out to be too much fun.
Ideally they will help me get a bit more familiar with the language before I
try to do something with it.
