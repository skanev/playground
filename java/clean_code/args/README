This code follows closely the refactoring steps in Chapter 14: Successive
Refinement in Clean Code. It is written as a programming exercise, partly to
follow Uncle Bob's reasoning up close and partly to reminiscent a bit about
Java and Eclipse.

In order to commit more to memory, I intend to get a bit too talkative in the
commit messages and this file. This is just a mnemonic device for my own good. 

Reflections:
 * Start dirty: add a class as an inner class first, get it working, then make
   it top level
 * Accumulate behavior in a single class, then split it in subclasses after
   enough feedback
 * Extracting subclasses: one by one, introducing methods in the parent and
   implementing them in the children
