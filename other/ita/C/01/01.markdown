There are $S_k = n - k + 1$ possible substrings of length $k$ (one starting at
the first position, one and the second, etc.)

In total there are:

$$ \begin{align}
   S &= S_1 + S_2 + \ldots + S_n \\\\
     &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}S_i \\\\
     &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}(n - i + 1) \\\\
     &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}n - \sum_{i=1}^{n}i + \sum_{i=1}^{n}1 \\\\
     &= n^2 - n(n + 1)/2 + n \\\\
     &= n^2 - n^2/2 - n/2 + n \\\\
     &= n(n + 1)/2 \qquad \text{(Duh!)}
     \end{align}$$

Obvious proof is obvious.
