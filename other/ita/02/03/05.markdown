Here's the presudocode:

    BINARY-SEARCH(A, v):
      low = 1
      high = A.length

      while low <= high
          mid = (low + high) / 2
          if A[mid] == v
              return mid
          if A[mid] < v
              low = mid + 1
          else
              high = mid - 1

      return NIL

The argument is fairly straightforward and I will make it brief:

$$ T(n+1) = T(n/2) + c $$

This is the recurrence shown in the chapter text, and we know, that this is
logarithmic time.
