I'm just happy that I don't need to write the loop invariant, since that seems tedious.

The formal statement:

---

**Input**: An array of booleans $A = \langle a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \rangle$, an array of
booleans $B = \langle b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \rangle$, each representing an integer stored
in binary format (each digit is a number, either 0 or 1, least-significant digit first) and each of length $n$.

**Output**: An array $C = \langle c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n+1} \rangle$ that such that
$C' = A' + B'$, where $A'$, $B'$ and $C'$ are the integers, represented by $A$, $B$ and $C$.

Here is the pseudocode:

    ADD-BINARY(A, B):
      C = new integer[A.length + 1]

      carry = 0
      for i = 1 to A.length
          C[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2  // remainder
          carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) / 2 // quotient
      C[i] = carry

      return C
