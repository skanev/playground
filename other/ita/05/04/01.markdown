The probability of a person not having the same birthday as me is $(n-1)/n$.
The probability of $k$ people not having the same birthday as me is that,
squared. We apply the same approach as the text - we take the complementary
event and solve it for $k$:

$$ 1 - \bigg(\frac{n-1}{k}\bigg)^k \ge \frac{1}{2} \\\\
   \bigg(\frac{n-1}{k}\bigg)^k \le \frac{1}{2} \\\\
   k\lg\bigg(\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg) \ge \lg\frac{1}{2} \\\\
   k = \frac{\log(1/2)}{\log(364/365)} \approx 263 $$

As for the other question:

$$ \begin{align}
   \Pr\\{\text{2 born on Jul 4}\\} &=
        1 - \Pr\\{\text{1 born on Jul 4}\\} - Pr\\{\text{0 born on Jul4}\\} \\\\
     &= 1 - \frac{k}{n}\bigg(\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg)^{k-1} - \bigg(\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg)^k \\\\
     &= 1 - \bigg(\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg)^{k-1}\bigg(\frac{n+k-1}{n}\bigg)
   \end{align} $$

Writing a Ruby programme to find the closest integer, we get 115.
