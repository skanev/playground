The answer is $88$. I reached it by trial and error. But let's analyze it with
indicator random variables.

Let $X_{ijk}$ be the indicator random variable for the event of the people with
indices $i$, $j$ and $k$ have the same birthday. The probability is $1/n^2$.
Then:

$$ \begin{align}
   \E[X] &= \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=i+1}^n\sum_{k=j+1}^nX_{ijk} \\\\
         &= \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=i+1}^n\sum_{k=j+1}^n\frac{1}{n^2} \\\\
         &= \binom{n}{3}\frac{1}{n^2} \\\\
         &= \frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{6n^2}
   \end{align} $$

Solving this yields $94$. It's a bit more, but again, indicator random
variables are approximate.

Finding more commentary online is tricky.
