## Probabilstic counting

### Expected value

Suppose at the start of the $j$th increment, the counter holds $i$, which
represents $n_i$. If the counter increases, then the value it will increase by
$n_{i+1} - n_i$. It happens with probability $1/(n_{i+1} - n_i)$, and so:

$$ \begin{aligned}
     \E[X_j] &= 0 \cdot \Pr\\{\text{stays same}\\} + 1 \cdot \Pr\\{\text{increases}\\} \\\\
             &= 0 \cdot \bigg(1 - \frac{1}{n_{i+1} - n_i}\bigg) +
                1 \cdot \bigg((n_{i+1} - n_i) \cdot \frac{1}{n_{i+1} - n_i}\bigg) \\\\
             &= 1
   \end{aligned} $$

This is the expectation any increment. Since there are $n$ increments, the
execpted value will be $n$.

### Variance

The variance of a single increment.

$$ \begin{aligned}
   \Var[X_j] &= \E[X_j^2] - \E^2[X_j] \\\\
             &= \bigg(0^2 \cdot \frac{99}{100} + 100^2 \frac{1}{100}\bigg) - 1 \\\\
             &= 99
   \end{aligned} $$

As for the variance of the total value:

$$ \Var[X] = \Var[X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n\Var[X_i] = 99n $$
