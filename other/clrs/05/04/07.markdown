Both of them are $n/e$ or at least are approximatelly close to it when $n$ is
large enough. Let's do empty bins first.

Let $X_i$ be the event that all the balls fall in bins, other than the $i$th.

$$ \Pr\\{X_i\\} = \bigg(\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg)^n
                = \bigg(1 - \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^n
                \approx \frac{1}{e} $$

The expectation:

$$ \E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n\E[X_i] = \frac{n}{e} $$

It's quite similar with exactly one ball. The probability is:

$$ \Pr\\{Y_i\\} = n\frac{1}{n}\bigg(\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg)^{n-1}
                = \bigg(\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg)^{n-1} \approx \frac{1}{e} $$

The expectation is the same.

Here's a [Math/StackExchange][question] question that clarifies it.
