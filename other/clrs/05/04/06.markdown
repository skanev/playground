$$ \Pr\\{k\text{-perm in }n\\} = 1 \cdot
                                 \frac{n-1}{n} \cdot
                                 \frac{n-2}{n} \cdots
                                 \frac{n-k+1}{n}
      = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!n^k} $$

This is the complementary event to the birthday problem, that is, the chance of
$k$ people have distinct birthdays.
