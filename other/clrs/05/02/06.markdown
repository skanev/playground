Let $X_{ij}$ be the event that there is an inversion between $i$ and $j$. The
probability of an inversion for each pair is $1/2$ because there are
$\binom{n}{2}$ possible pairs and the probability of having the larger number
first is $\frac{1}{n(n-1)}$. Dividing the two yields $1/2$. Thus we get that
$\E[X_{ij}] = 1/2$.

$$ \E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^n \E[X_{ij}]
         = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^n \frac{1}{2}
         = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^n 1
         = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i)
         = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i
         = \frac{n(n-1)}{4}
         = \binom{n}{2}/2
$$
