The probability that each person gets their hat back is $1/n$. Let $X_i$ be the
event that the $i$th person gets their hat back. Thus:

$$ \E[X] = \E[X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n]
         = \sum_{i=1}^n \E[X_i]
         = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n}
         = 1 $$

Yup.

One person will get their hat back. I'm surprised too.
