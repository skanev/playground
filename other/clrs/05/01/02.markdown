Let $n = b - a$. The algorithm is as follows:

1. We find the smallest integer $c$ such that $2^c \ge n$ ($c = \lceil \ln{n} \rceil$)
2. We call `RANDOM(0, 1)` $c$ times to and get a $c$-digit binary number $r$
3. If $r > n$ we go back to the previous step
4. Otherwise we return $a + r$

This produces a uniformly random number in that range. However, there is a
possibility to have to repeat step 2. There is $p = n/2^c$ chance of not having
to repeat step two. The geometric distribution suggests that on average it
takes $1/p$ trials before we get such a number, that is $2^c/n$ trials. Since
we perform $c$ calls to `RANDOM(0, 1)` on each trial, the expected running time
is

$$ \O\bigg(\frac{2^c}{n} c\bigg) = \O\bigg(\frac{\ln(b-a)2^{\ln(b-a)}}{b-a}\bigg)
                                 = \O(\ln(b-a)) $$
