**Initialization**. The subarray $A[i + 1 \ldots n]$ is empty, thus the
invariant holds.

**Maintenance**. $A[1]$ is the largest element in $A[1 \ldots i]$ and it is
smaller than the elements in $A[i + 1 \ldots n]$. When we put it in the $i$th
position, then $A[i \ldots n]$ contains the largest elements, sorted.
Decreasing the heap size and calling `MAX-HEAPIFY` turns $A[1 \ldots i-1]$ into
a max-heap. Decrementing $i$ sets up the invariant for the next iteration.

**Termination**. After the loop $i = 1$. This means that $A[2 \ldots n]$ is
sorted and $A[1]$ is the smallest element in the array, which makes the array
sorted.
