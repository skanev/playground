    MIN-HEAPIFY(A, i)
      l = LEFT(i)
      r = RIGHT(i)
      if l ≤ A.heap-size and A[l] < A[i]
          smallest = l
      else
          smallest = i
      if r ≤ A.heap-size and A[r] < A[i]
          smallest = r
      if smallest ≠ i
          exchange A[i] with A[smallest]
          MIN-HEAPIFY(A, smallest)

The running time is the same. Actually, the algorithm is the same with the
exceptions of two comparisons and some names.
