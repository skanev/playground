The heap is organized in a way such that every level apart from the last one is
full. The worst case scenario is when the bottom row is half full, that is, the
left child of the root has an extra full level.

This way, if the height of the heap is $h$, then the left child will have
$2^{h-1} = 2 \cdot 2^{h-2}$ nodes, while the right will have $2^{h-2}$ nodes.
That is, the left child will have twice as many nodes as the right one, or at
most $2/3$ of all ($2n/3 - 1$ because of the root, to be exact).
