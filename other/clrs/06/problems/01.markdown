## Building a heap using insertion

### Same heaps?

No. They produce different heaps. This is illustrated with $\langle 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 \rangle$. Results are shown below.

### Complexity

`MAX-HEAP-INSERT` is a $\Theta(\lg{n})$ operation in the worst case and it gets
called $n - 1$ times. `MAX-HEAP-INSERT` might need to pull each element up to
the beginning of the heap, that is, $\lg{k}$ operations whatever $k$ currently
is. The worst case happens when the array is sorted. Thus the complexity is:

$$ \sum_{i=2}^{n}\lg{i} = \lg(n!) = \Theta(n\lg{n})$$

The above is due to exercise 3.2.3.
