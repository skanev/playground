Both are simple. For a stack we keep adding elements in increasing priority,
while in a queue we add them in decreasing priority. For the stack we can set
the new priority to `HEAP-MAXIMUM(A) + 1`. For the queue we need to keep track
of it and decrease it on every insertion.

Both are not very efficient. Furthermore, if the priority can overflow or
underflow, so will eventually need to reassign priorities.
