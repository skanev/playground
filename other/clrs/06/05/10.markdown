This is the pseudocode is as follows:

    MAX-HEAP-DELETE(A, x):
      MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A, x, âˆž)
      MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX(A)

This is slightly tricky, as ultimately we have to move the last item of the
heap, but we don't quite know where to put it. A simple way to accomplish it
would be:

1. Increase the key of the element to be deleted to move it to the root.
2. Extract the max, which is now the element we want to remove.
