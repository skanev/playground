This should be simple:

    MAX-HEAP-DECREASE-KEY(A, x, k):
      if x.key < k
        error "new key is larger than current key"
      x.key = k
      MAX-HEAPIFY(A, x)

Basically, we just decrease the key, which could now violate the max-heap
property, so we need to call `MAX-HEAPIFY`. Of course, we have to make sure
we're actually decreasing the key, otherwise we can violate the property for the
parent.
