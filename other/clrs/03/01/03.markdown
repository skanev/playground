The problem formulation pretty much gives the answer. When we use $\alpha$ this
way, we end up moving $\alpha n$ elements over $(1 - 2\alpha)n$ positions, that
is, a total number of:

$$ T = \alpha n \cdot (1 - 2 \alpha)n = (\alpha - 2\alpha^2)n^2 $$

In this case, we need $\alpha < 1/2$, otherwise we get problematic results.


$\alpha$ can't be $1/n$ either (or a function of $n$ in general), because it
would cancel one of the $n$s in $n^2$. For example, if we had $\alpha = 1/n$, we
get...

$$ T = \frac{1}{n} \frac{n-2}{n} n^2 = n - 2 = \Theta(n) $$

...which is not correct.
