To prove $\Theta$, we need to prove $\Omega$ and $\O$. $\Omega$ is pretty
trivial, as we can just plug $0$ for the $o(n)$ function, and it holds. We'll
need (3.14), which is $1 + x \le e^x$, for the $\O$ part.

Unpacking the definition, $o(n)$ means that it is a function $f(n)$ such that
$f(n) < cn$ for any constant $c$ given large enough $n_0$. We can also express
it as:

$$ \frac{f(n)}{n} < c $$

Therefore, when we start expanding:

$$
  (n + f(n))^k
  = \big(n(1 + \frac{f(n)}{n})\big)^k
  = n^k(1 + \frac{f(n)}{n})^k
  < n^k(1 + c)^k
  = n^k(e^c)^k
  = e^{ck}n^k
$$

Since $e^{ck}$ is a constant, this is $\O(n^k)$.

The floors and ceilings follow from that, as $\lceil n \rceil < n + 1$ and that
is the constant $1$ is clearly $o(n)$.
