So:

$$ f(m) \leq f(n) \quad \text{for } m \leq n \\\\
   g(m) \leq f(n) \quad \text{for } m \leq n \\\\ $$

When we combine them, we get:

$$ f(m) + g(m) \leq f(n) + g(n) $$

Which proves the first function.

Then:

$$ f(g(m)) \leq f(g(n)) \quad \text{for } m \leq n $$

This is true, since $g(m) > g(n)$ and $f(n)$ is monotonically increasing.

If both functions are nonnegative, then we can multiply the two inequalities
and we get:

$$ f(m) \cdot g(m) \leq f(n) \cdot g(n) $$
