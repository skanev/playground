### Omega infinity

We need to compare:

$$ cg(n) \leq f(n) $$

Either this holds for an infinite number of integers or for a finite one (or
zero). If the former, we have $\mathop{\Omega}^{\infty}$. If it is a finite
number, then the largest is $n_0$ and we have that:

$$ \forall n > n_0: f(n) < cg(n) $$

Which is sufficient for $f(n) = O(g(n))$. Both can hold if $f(n) = g(n)$,
obviously.

It's not true for $\Omega$, because $n = \mathop{\Omega}^{\infty}(n^{\sin{n}})$,
but $n \neq \Omega(n^{\sin{n}})$.

### Potential advantages

I can't think of anything meaningful. It lets us reason for functions like
$n^{\sin{n}}$, but I'm not sure that lower bound is the most useful thing
here.

### $O'$

Theorem 3.1 will change the "if and only if" to "implies", that is, $\Theta
\Rightarrow O'$, but not the other way around. This can be illustrated by
$f(n) = n \cdot \sin{n}$, which is $O'(n)$, but not $O(n)$ or $\Theta(n)$.

### Soft-oh

I'm uncertain how we should define $\tilde{\Omega}$. I assume that $n =
\tilde{\Omega}(n\lg{n})$. In that case,

$$ \tilde{\Omega} = \lbrace f(n) : \exists c, k, n \forall n > n_0 :
   0 \leq cg(n) \lg^{-k}(n) \leq f(n) \rbrace $$

And:

$$ \tilde{\Theta} = \lbrace f(n) : \exists c_1, c_2, k_1, k_2, n \forall n > n_0 :
   0 \leq c_1g(n) \lg^{-k_1}(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2g(n) \lg^{k_2}(n)\rbrace $$

Proving the theorem is very trivial.
