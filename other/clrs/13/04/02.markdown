First, let's observe that all the cases in `RB-DELETE-FIXUP` retains the color
of the root of the subtree. If the deleted node is not the root or an immediate
descendent of the root, the root's color will remain the same, regardless of
rotations.

The only case that's not obvious is when the deleted node is the root and it has
a single child. In this case, `RB-DELETE-FIXUP` will immediately color it red,
and the property will be preserved.
