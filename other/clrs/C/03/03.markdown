Here are the probabilities:

$$ \Pr\\{X = 3\\} = 1/216 \\\\
   \Pr\\{X = 2\\} = 3(6/216) - 3(1/126) = 15/216 \\\\
   \Pr\\{X = 1\\} = 3(36/216) - 3(11/216) = 75/216 \\\\
   \Pr\\{X = 0\\} = 125/216 $$

(There are 36 ways that a specific die is $k$, but in 10 of them one of the
other die is also $k$ and in one of them both are).

Here's the calculation:

$$ \begin{aligned}
   \E[X] &= -1 \cdot \Pr\\{X = 0\\} +
             1 \cdot \Pr\\{X = 1\\} +
             2 \cdot \Pr\\{X = 2\\} +
             3 \cdot \Pr\\{X = 3\\} \\\\
         &= - 1 \cdot \frac{125}{216}
            + 1 \cdot \frac{75}{216}
            + 2 \cdot \frac{15}{216}
            + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{216} \\\\
         &= - \frac{17}{216} \\\\
         &= -0.07\ldots
   \end{aligned} $$

Turns out you loose ever so slightly. This did not match my intuition.
