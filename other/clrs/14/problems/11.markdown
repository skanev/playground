## Inventory planning

> The Rinky Dink Company makes machines that resurface ice rinks. The demand for
> such products varies from month to month, and so the company needs to develop
> a strategy to plan its manufacturing given the fluctuating, but predictable,
> demand. The company wishes to design a plan for the next $n$ months. For each
> month $i$, the company knows the demand $d_i$, that is, the number of machines
> that it will sell. Let $D = \sum_{i=1}^n d_i$ be the total demand over the
> next $n$ months. The company keeps a full-time staff who provide labor to
> manufacture up to $m$ machines per month. If the company needs to make more
> than $m$ machines in a given month, it can hire additional, part-time labor,
> at a cost that works out to $c$ dollars per machine. Furthermore, if the
> company is holding any unsold machines at the end of a month, it must pay
> inventory costs. The company can hold up to $D$ machines, with the cost for
> holding $j$ machines given as a function $h(j)$ for $j = 1, 2, \ldots, D$ that
> monotonically increases with $j$.
>
> Give an algorithm that calculates a plan for the company that minimizes its
> costs while fulfilling all the demand. The running time should be polynomial
> in $n$ and $D$.
