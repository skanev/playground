A bit obviously, but the subproblems stop being independent now. When choosing a
cut, we have to balance the remaining number of cuts to add up to at most a
given number.

I think this could be solved with tweaking the algorithm to use a table for
memoization instead of an array, so we have both the rod length and the maximum
number of cuts. Nobody is asking me to implement it, however, so I'll opt out
not to.
