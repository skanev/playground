The algorithm is pretty straightforward, and outlined below – you subtract $c$
from the calculation whenever there is a cut to be made.

But more importantly, it reduces to the original problem – if we subtract $c$
from each $p_i$ and then add $c$ back to the result, we get the same value and
the same cuts.
