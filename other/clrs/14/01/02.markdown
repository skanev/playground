Let us have the following options of rod length.

| Length  |  5 |  4 | 1 |
|---------|---:|---:|--:|
| Cost    | 10 |  7 | 1 |
| Density |  2 | 1Â¾ | 1 |

Let's look at a rod of length 8. The greedy algorithm will choose $5 + 1 + 1 +
1$ with value $13$. In comparison, if we just cut it $4 + 4$, we are going to
get value $14$.
