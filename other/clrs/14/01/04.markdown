So, that means essentially calling `CUT-ROD(i) + CUT-ROD(n - i)`. We need to
initialize `q` with with the price from `p` if one is available, otherwise we
won't terminate correctly.

The running time remains unaffected asymptotically, although the non-memoized
version gets a bit "more exponential", as if that meant anything.
