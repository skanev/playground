It's not commutative. Let's explore the following tree:

         2
       /   \
     1       4
            /
           3

If we first delete 1, and then 2 we get:

         2              4
           \          /
             4      3
            /
           3

If we do it the other way around, deleting 2 first, we replace it with its
successor (3) and then when we delete 1, we get:

         3          3
       /   \          \
     1       4          4
