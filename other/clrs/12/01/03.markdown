We already implemented that in Exercise 10.4.5.

The summarize:

1. We need the node to have a pointer to the parent.
2. We keep track of a current node (starting at root) and a previous node
   (starting at nil)
3. At each step, we use the previous node to determine which is the last element
   element we visited. If it's the parent, we proceed to the left child. If it's
   the left child, we print/mark the element and continue to the right child. If
   it's the right child, we move up.
