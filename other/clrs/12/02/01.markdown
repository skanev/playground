Each element of the sequence asserts something for the following elements,
namely, that they are greater than it if it's smaller than the searched one, or
smaller than it, if it is greater. E.g. in the first sequence, the first
element asserts that the following are > 2, the second that it's following are >
252, the third that they are < 401 and so on. Thus:

* 3 is invalid because 912 > 911
* 5 is invalid because 229 < 347

The rest are valid.
