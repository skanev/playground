### Running time

It will be $\Theta(n^2)$, because each split will be (n-1)-to-1 (see exercise
7.1-2).

### Implementation

The code is below.

`PARTITION'` is very similar to `PARTITION`, except that after it completes
arranging the elements around a pivot $q$, it moves all elements $t > q: A[t] =
x$ right after $q$. That way we get a chuck of equal elements after the pivot.

The procedure makes another pass at the array, which is at most $n$ more time
and becuse $\Theta(n) + \Theta(n) = \Theta(n) = \Theta(r - p)$ we fulfill the
condition.

### Analysis

The analysis does not change much. Section 7.4.2 uses the knowledge that the
elements are distinct in order to determine when two elements cannot be
compared. It will still be true that in any interval $Z_{ij}$, two elements
will get compared only if $z_i$ or $z_j$ gets picked as a pivot first. This
would not hold with `PARTITION'` if there are repeated elements.

Note that with this implementation, the number of comparisons increases, but
only by a constant factor. The results from the analysis are the same.
