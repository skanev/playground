First, for simplicity's sake, let's assume that we can pick the same element
twice.

In order to get such a split, two out of three elements need need to be in the
smallest $\alpha n$ elements. The probability of having one is $\alpha n / n =
\alpha$. The probability of having exactly two is $\alpha^2 - \alpha^3$. There
are three ways in which two elements can be in the smallest $\alpha n$ and one
way in which all three can be in the smallest $\alpha n$ so the probability of
getting such a median is $3\alpha^2 - 2\alpha^3$. We will get the same split if
the median is in the largest $\alpha n$. Since the two events are mutually
exclusive, the probability is:

$$ \Pr\\{\text{OK split}\\} = 6\alpha^2 - 4\alpha^3 = 2\alpha^2(3 - 2\alpha) $$
