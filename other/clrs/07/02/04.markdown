A simple intuitive argument will suffice here.

The more sorted the array is, the less work insertion sort will do. Namely,
`INSERTION-SORT` is $\Theta(n + d)$, where $d$ is the number of inversions in
the array. In the example above the number of inversions tends to be small so
insertion sort will be close to linear.

On the other hand, if `PARTITION` does picks a pivot that does not participate
in an inversion, it will produce and empty partition. Since there is a small
number of inversions, `QUICKSORT` is very likely to produce empty partitions.
