The minimum depth of the tree is the solution of $n\alpha^x \le 1$:

$$ n\alpha^x \le 1 \\\\
   \Downarrow \\\\
   \alpha^x \le \frac 1 n \\\\
   \Downarrow \\\\
   x \ge \log_{\alpha}\frac{1}{n} \\\\
   \Downarrow \\\\
   \log_{\alpha}\frac{1}{n} = \log_{1/\alpha}
                            = \frac{\lg{n}}{\lg(1/\alpha)}
                            = - \frac{\lg{n}}{\lg{\alpha}}
$$

In the same way, the maximum depth is $\log_{1/(1-\alpha)}n = - \frac{\lg{n}}{\lg(1-\alpha)}$
