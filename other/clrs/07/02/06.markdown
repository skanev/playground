Oh, this is nice!

In order to produce a worse split than $\alpha$ to $1 - \alpha$, `PARTITION`
must pick a pivot that will be either within the smallest $\alpha n$ elements
or the largest $\alpha n$ elements. The probability of either is
(approximately) $\alpha n / n = \alpha$ and the probability of both is
$2\alpha$. Thus, the probability of having a better partition is the complement,
$1 - 2\alpha$.

Sweet!
