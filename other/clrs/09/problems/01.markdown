### Sorting

We can sort with any of the $n\lg{n}$ algorithms, that is, merge sort or heap
sort and then just take the first $i$ elements linearly.

This will take $n\lg{n} + i$ time.

### Max-priority queue

We can build the heap linearly and then take each of the largest $i$ elements
in logarithmic time.

This takes $n + i\lg{n}$.

### Partition and sort

Let's assume we use the `SELECT` algorithm from the chapter. We can find the
$i$th order statistic and partition around it in $n$ time and then we need to
do a sort in $i\lg{i}$.

This takes $n + i\lg{i}$
