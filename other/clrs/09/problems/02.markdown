The worst case happens when `RANDOMIZED-PARTITION` picks the median. If it keeps
picking the median, we will keep iterating, without reducing the size of the
subarray ad-infinitum.

I feel the argument about the expected time is still the same with the
probabilistic analysis, but I'm too lazy to try and make it formal.
