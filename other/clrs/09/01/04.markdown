Each comparison can reduce both the potential minimums and maximums by one.
Note that this is now always the case if we make two comparisons to infer that
$a < b$ and $a < c$, we have excluded two elements from the potential minimums
($b$ and $c$), but only one from the potential maximums ($a$).

We can optimize by splitting the input in pairs and comparing each pair. After
$n/2$ comparisons, we have reduced the potential minimums and potential
maximums to $n/2$ each. Furthermore, those two sets are disjoint so now we
have two problems, one minimum and one maximum, each of size $n/2$. The total
number of comparisons is:

$$ n/2 + 2(n/2 - 1) = n/2 + n - 2 = 3n/2 - 2 $$

This assumes that $n$ is even. If $n$ is odd we need one additional comparison
in order to determine whether the last element is a potential minimum or
maximum. Hence the ceiling.
