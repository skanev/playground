This is apparently a well-known problem. We can do it in 7 races.

First, we group the horses into fives and race them. We keep track of those
initial groups. Then we take the winners and race them again. This determines
the fastest horse.

Let A be the group of the fastest horse, B of the horse that came second in the
previous round and C be the one that came third. If we take 2nd and 3rd from A,
1st and 2nd from B and the 1st in C, we end up with five horses. When we race
them for a seventh race, the winner will be the 2nd fastest and the one after it
would be the 3rd fastest.
