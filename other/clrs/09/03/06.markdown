We find the median in linear time partition the array around it (again, in
linear time). If the median index (always $\lceil n/2 \rceil$) equals $n$ we
return the median. Otherwise, we recurse either in the lower or upper part of
the array, adjusting $n$ accordingly.

This yields the following recurrence:

$$ T(n) = T(n/2) + \O(n) $$

Applying the master method, we get an upper bound of $\O(n)$.
