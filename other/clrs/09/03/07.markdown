We just find the median of the $y$ coordinates. The $x$ coordinates are
irrelevant.

Let's assume that $n$ is odd. There are $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ south of the
median and the same amount of wells north of the median. Let the pipeline pass
through the median. We shall reason about why this location is optimal.

Suppose we move the pipeline one meter north. This reduces the total pipe
length with $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ meters for the pipes north of the median,
but adds another $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ for the pipes south of median, including
the median itself. The more we move north, the more the total pipe length will
increase. The same reasoning holds if we move the main pipeline south.

If $n$ is even, then any location between the lower and upper median is
optimal.
