1. If $k = 1$ we return an empty list.
2. If $k$ is even, we find the median, partition around it, solve two similar
   subproblems of size $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ and return their solutions plus
   the median.
3. If $k$ is odd, we find the $\lfloor k/2 \rfloor$ and $\lceil k/2 \rceil$
   boundaries and the we reduce to two subproblems, each with size less than
   $n/2$.
The worst case recurrence is:

$$ T(n, k) = 2T(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor, k / 2) + O(n) $$

Which is the desired bound Â­ $\O(n\lg{k})$.

This works easily when the number of elements is $ak + k - 1$ for a positive
integer $a$. When they are a different number, some care with rounding needs
to be taken in order to avoid creating two segments that differ by more than
1.
