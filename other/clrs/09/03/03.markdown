If we rewrite `PARTITION` to use the same approach as `SELECT`, it will
perform in $\O(n)$ time, but the smallest partition will be at least
one-fourth of the input (for large enough $n$, as illustrated in
exercise 9.3.2). This will yield a worst-case recurrence of:

$ T(n) = T(n/4) + T(3n/4) + \O(n) $

As of exercise 4.4.9, we know that this is $\Theta(n\lg{n})$.

And that's how we can prevent quicksort from getting quadratic in the worst
case, although this approach probably has a constant that is too large for
practical purposes.

Another approach would be to find the median in linear time (with `SELECT`)
and partition around it. That will always give an even split.
