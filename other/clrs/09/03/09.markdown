This is a fun exercise.

1. We find the median of the array in linear time
2. We find the distance of each other element to the median in linear time
3. We find the $k$-th order statistic of the distance, again, in linear time
4. We select only the elements that have distance lower than or equal to the
   $k$-th order statistic
