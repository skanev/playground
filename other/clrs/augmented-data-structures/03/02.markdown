This is pretty minor, and I'm not gonna bother doing the full thing. We need to
do to things to the code in Exercise 14.3-1:

* change the definition of `overlaps` to exclude the boundary conditions, that
  is, change `<=` to `<` in the comparisons;
* use `>` instead of `>=` when comparing `node.left.max` and `interval.low` in
  `Tree.search`.
