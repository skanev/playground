I'm uncertain about why the star on this exercise.

Fundamentally, the problem is nicely aligned so that

$$ x.f = x.left.f \otimes x.a \otimes x.right.f $$

...for every $x$ in the tree. In order to get it to work, we need to:

* Recalculate $f$ for each parent of a newly inserted node (before the fixup)
* Recalculate $f$ for each parent of the newly deleted node (before the fixup)
* Recalculate $f$ on each rotation, but first recalculating it for the lower
  node, and then the upper

For tracking the size, we just have that $a = 1$ for each node other than the
sentinel $nil$ (where $a = 0$) and $\otimes = +$.
