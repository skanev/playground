We can maintain the black heights, although we need to be careful with the
various recoloring that's happening when we're going up the tree on insertion
and deletion. Then it's quite simple to do it when rotations happen. I'm not
going to show it, as I don't think it's that interesting.

Depth won't work, because if we remove the root, we may need to update the depth
of all $n$ nodes.
