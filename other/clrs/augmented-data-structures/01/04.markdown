In order for the function to be recursive, $T$ needs to be a pointer to a node,
not a tree. Otherwise, it won't be recursive.

Here's the python version:

```python
def key_rank(node, key):
    if node.key == key:
        return node.left.size + 1
    elif key < node.key:
        return node.left.key_rank(key)
    else:
        return node.left.size + 1 + node.right.key_rank(key)
```
