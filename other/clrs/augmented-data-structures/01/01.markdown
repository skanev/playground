It does the following:

```plain
1. k = 26; i = 10; r = 13; goes into the elseif in line 5; follows left child
2. k = 17; i = 10; r = 8;  goes into the else in line 6; follows right child;
3. k = 21; i = 2;  r = 3;  goes into the elseif in line 5; follows left child;
4. k = 19; i = 2;  r = 1;  goes into the else in line 6; follows right child;
5. k = 20; i = 1;  r = 1;  returns 20
```
