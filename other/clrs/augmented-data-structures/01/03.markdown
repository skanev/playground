> Write a non-recursive version of `OS-SELECT`

Here's the Python code:

```python
def select(node, i):
    while node:
        rank = node.left.size + 1

        if i == rank:
            return node
        elif i < rank:
            node = node.left
        else:
            i -= rank
            node = node.right
```

Below is the whole thing.
