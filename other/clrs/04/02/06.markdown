Heh, this is funky.

Let's say we want to calculate $AB$. We can build a $2n \times 2n$ matrix like
this:

$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    A & B \\\
    0 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}^2
  = \begin{pmatrix}
    A^2 & AB \\\
    0 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

Therefore, we can put the two matrices next to each other in a larger matrix,
square it, and then return a submatrix.
