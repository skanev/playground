This is not too interesting to do, so I'm going to sketch two ideas.

First, and quite simply, we can extend the matrix to be $n \times n$ and pad
with zeroes. We can multiply those and then take a submatrix.

Alternatively, we can modify the function to take an extra argument $m$ that is
the next power of 2, use it to make the splits, but don't add up if the index is
greated than $n$.

Both of those are very obviously cubic.
