Multiplying $(kn \times n)(n \times kn)$ will result to a $kn \times kn$ matrix
and will need to do $\Theta(k^2 n^3)$ multiplications. Multiplying $(n \times
kn)(kn \times n)$ will result to a $n \times n$ matrix and can be done with
$\Theta(k n^3)$ multiplications. The recursive multiplications do not help at
all here.

Generally, when multiplying $(a \times b)(b \times c)$, it will take
$\Theta(abc)$ time unless some cleverness is done.
