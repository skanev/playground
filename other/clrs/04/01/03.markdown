The recurrence will change from

$$ T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \Theta(1) $$

to

$$ T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \Theta(n^2) $$

as it takes $\Theta(n^2)$ things to do in order to copy matrices and add them
back. The solution to this is still $\Theta(n^3)$ and it can be illustrated by
either the substitution method or the master method.
