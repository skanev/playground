To fall in third case of the master theorem, we need to have $a < 16$. In that case,
the algorithm will be $T(n) = \Theta(n^2)$. For the second case, with $a = 16$, $T(n) = \Theta(n^2 \log n)$. In the first case of the master theorem, to be faster than Strassen, we need
$\log_4{a} < \log_{2}7$, which is $a < 7^2 = 49$. Thus, the largest integer value will
be $48$.
