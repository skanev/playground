We need to get:

$$ \lg(n/2) \le c \lg(n) $$

If we transform this a bit, we get:

$$
  \lg(n/2) \le c \lg(n) \\\\
  \lg(n) - \ln 2 \le c \lg(n) \\\\
  \lg(n) - 1 \le c \lg(n) \\\\
  \frac{\lg(n) - 1}{\lg(n)} \le c \\\\
  c \ge \frac{\lg(n) - 1}{\lg(n)}
$$

Thus term on the right-hand side goes to $1$ as $n \to \infty$. Thus, any way we
pick $c < 1$, there will always be some $n_0$ such that for $n \ge n_0$ the
inequality does not hold.

The second part is essentially asking us to compare the order of growth of
$\lg(n)$ and $n^{\log_{b}{a+\epsilon}} = n^{\log_{2}(1)+\epsilon} =
n^{\epsilon}$. We know that $n^{\epsilon}$ grows faster than $\lg(n)$, so this
is why the condition does not hold.
