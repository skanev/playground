For $n^2$, let's pick our $d = \phi ^ 2 + 1$. We need to show that for every
$\psi: 1 \le \psi \le \phi$:

$$ f(n)/d \le f(\psi n) \le df(n) $$

That is:

$$ \frac{n^2}{\phi ^ 2 + 1} \le \psi^2 n^2 \le (\phi^2 + 1)n^2 $$

Or else:

$$ \frac{1}{\phi ^ 2 + 1} \le \psi^2 \le \phi^2 + 1 $$

This very obviously holds for any $\psi: 1 \le \psi \le phi$.

For $2^n$, we will need to pick:

$$ 2^n/d \le 2^{\psi n} \le d2^n $$

If we take only the second inequality and move $d$ in the exponent:

$$ 2^{\psi n} \le 2^{n + \lg d} $$

And then taking the logarithm, we get:

$$ \psi n \le n + \lg d $$

There is no way to pick $d$ so this will hold for all $n \ge \hat{n}$.
