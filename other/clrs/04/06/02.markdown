$$ af(n/b) \le cf(n) \\\\
   \alpha f(n/b) \le f(n), \quad \alpha = a/c \\\\
   \alpha f(n) \le f(nb) \\\\
   \alpha^i f(1) \le f(b^i) \\\\
   n = b^i \Rightarrow i = \log_{b}n \Rightarrow f(n) \ge \alpha^{\log_b{n}}f(1) = n^{\log_{b}\alpha} \\\\
   \alpha > a \Rightarrow \alpha = a + d \quad (c < 1, d > 0) \\\\
   \Rightarrow f(n) = n^{\log_b{a} + log_b{d}} = n^{\log_b{a}+\epsilon} \quad (\epsilon = \log_{b}d) $$

I did not think this up. I had [some help][help] at StackExchange.
