The pseudocode looks like this:

    SEARCH(A, v):
      for i = 1 to A.length
          if A[i] == v
              return i
      return NIL

I'm going to state the loop invariant as:

> At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray $A[1..i - 1]$ consists
> of elements that are different than $\nu$.

Here are the three properties:

---

#### Initialization

Initially the subarray is the empty array, so proving it is trivial.

#### Maintenance

On each step, we know that $A[1..i-1]$ does not contain $\nu$. We compare it with $A[i]$. If they are the same, we return $i$, which is a correct result. Otherwise, we continue to the next step. We have already insured that $A[A..i-1]$ does not contain $\nu$ and that $A[i]$ is different from $\nu$, so this step preserves the invariant.

#### Termination

The loop terminates when $i > A.length$. Since $i$ increases by $1$ and $i > A.length$, we know that all the elements in $A$ have been checked and it has been found that $\nu$ is not among them. Thus, we return $NIL$.
