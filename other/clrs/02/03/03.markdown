The loop invariant(s) here is: $A[1:k]$ is sorted and contains only elements
smaller than the ones in $L$ and $R$. The termination condition also guarantees
that either $L$ or $R$ is empty.

We use it by illustrating that the two later white loops keep the invariant that
$A[1:k]$ is sorter and its elements are smaller than $L$/$R$.
