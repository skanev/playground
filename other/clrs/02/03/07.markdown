First we sort $S$. Afterwards, we iterate it and for each element $i$ we
perform a binary search to see if there is an element equal to $x - i$. If one
is found, the algorithm returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

We iterate $n$ elements and perform binary search for each on in an $n$-sized
array, which leads to $\Theta(n\lg{n})$-time. If we sort first (with merge
sort) it will introduce another $\Theta(n\lg{n})$ time, that would change the
constant in the final algorithm, but not the asymptotic time.

Here's the pseudocode:

    PAIR-EXISTS(S, x):
      A = MERGE-SORT(S)

      for i = 1 to S.length
          if BINARY-SEARCH(A, x - S[i]) != NIL
              return true

      return false
