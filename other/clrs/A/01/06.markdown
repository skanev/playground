> Prove that $\sum_{k=1}^{n} O(f_k(i)) = O(\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k(i))$

I am not sure whether the following prove is really meaningful.

$$
\begin{align}
	\sum_{k=1}^{n} O(f_k(i))	&= O(f_1(i)) + O(f_2(i)) + ... + O(f_n(i)) \\
					&= O(f_1(i) + f_2(i) + ... + f_n(i)) \\
					&= O\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k(i)\right)
\end{align}
$$
