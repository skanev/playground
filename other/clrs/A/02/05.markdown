> Why didnâ€™t we use the integral approximation (A.12) directly on $\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/k$ to obtain an upper bound on the nth harmonic number?

\frac{1}{k} is a monotonically decreasing function. To obtain an upper bound,

$$
\int_{0}^{n} \frac{1}{k} dk
$$

is to be calculated. However, this is undefined as $\frac{1}{0}$ is undefined.

(I am not sure about this answer. I think calculating $\int_{1/2}^{n} \frac{1}{k} dk$ can also get the correct answer.)
