> Consider a hash table with 9 slots and the hash function $h(k) = k \bmod 9$.

First, let's calculate the hashes:

    h(5)  = 5
    h(28) = 1
    h(19) = 1
    h(15) = 6
    h(20) = 2
    h(33) = 6
    h(12) = 3
    h(17) = 8
    h(10) = 1

Next, let's ASCII-ART this bad boy:

      +-----+
    0 |     |
      +-----+
    1 |  o--|---> [ 10 ] ---> [ 19 ] ---> [ 28 ]
      +-----+
    2 |  o--|---> [ 20 ]
      +-----+
    3 |  o--|---> [ 12 ]
      +-----+
    4 |     |
      +-----+
    5 |  o--|---> [  5 ]
      +-----+
    6 |  o--|---> [ 33 ] ---> [ 15 ]
      +-----+
    7 |     |
      +-----+
    8 |  o--|---> [ 17 ]
      +-----+

Where each cell of the array is a null pointer (empty bucket) or the pointer to
a head of a linked list.
