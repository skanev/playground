I'm not sure the professor is right.

If we assume with delete with a key (instead of a pointer to an element), we
have the following times (with regards to the number of collisions) without
sorting:

| operation | complexity     |
|-----------|----------------|
| `SEARCH`  | linear (both)  |
| `INSERT`  | constant       |
| `DELETE`  | linear         |

The only thing that changes when we sort the list, is that instead of prepending
the item to the list, we have to find its right place, making `INSERT` linear:

| operation | complexity     |
|-----------|----------------|
| `SEARCH`  | linear (both)  |
| `INSERT`  | **linear**     |
| `DELETE`  | linear         |

I'm not sure what the professor had in mind, but I believe he was mistaken.
