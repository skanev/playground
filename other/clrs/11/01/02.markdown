The elements have to be numbers.

Each bit in the bit vector represents whether an element is present (1) or not
present (0) in the dynamic set. This is sufficient when we're not storing
satellite data. We need to use some binary operations (`&`, `|`) in order to
modify the bit vector or query it.

The operations are pretty straightforward. The only tricky part is the bit
vector size. If a dynamic set is to store the element `1000`, then the vector
needs to be at least `1000` bits.
