We can compute the hash of the key we search for, and then compare with a string
in the list only if the hash value matches. We know that the same key hashes to
the same hash value, so if the hash values are different, we can infer the
strings are different.

It will have an effect when the strings in the list have particularly bad
comparison performance against the string we search for. For example, the
comparison algorithm checks the first characters, and if they differ, the second
characters, etc, and the strings have a very long common prefix.
