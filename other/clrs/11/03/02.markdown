Yes, this follows pretty easily from the laws of modulo arithmetic. We need to
observe that if the string is $s = \langle a_n, \ldots, a\_1, a\_0 \rangle$,
then its hash $h(s)$ is going to be:

$$
    \begin{align}
      h(s) &= \left( \sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_i \cdot {128}^{i}} \right) \bmod m \\\\
           &= \sum_{i=0}^{n}{ \Big( \left( a_i \cdot {128}^{i} \right) \bmod m \Big) } \\\\
           &= \sum_{i=0}^{n}{ \Big( ( a_i \bmod m ) ( {128}^{i} \bmod m ) \Big) } \\\\
    \end{align}
$$

We can easily compute $a_i \bmod m$ without extra memory. To compute ${128}^{i}
\bmod m$ without extra memory, we just need to observe that $k^i \bmod m =
k(k^{i-1} \bmod m) \bmod m$, that is, we can compute the module for each power
incrementally, without ever needing unbound memory.
