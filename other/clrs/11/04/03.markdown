Those come directly from our formulas:

| $\alpha$ | Unsuccessful | Successful |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| $3/4$    | $4$          | $1.84839$  |
| $7/8$    | $8$          | $2.37650$  |

What I find interesting, is that successful searches are dramatically less
probes than unsuccessful searches. This implies that with uniform hashing the
load factor can be pretty high if we're using the hash looking things up as
opposed to checking if an element exists.
