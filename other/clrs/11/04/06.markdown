Using the theorems, we get the following equation:

$$ \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} = 2 \frac{1}{\alpha} \ln{\left(\frac{1}{1 - \alpha}\right)} $$

We can try to simplify it, but we get to a $x = 2 \ln x - 1$, or something
similar, which I don't know how to solve in closed form.

Luckily, that's why SciPY exists.
