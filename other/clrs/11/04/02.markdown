Deleting an element:

    HASH-DELETE(T, k)
      i = 0
      repeat
          j = h(k, i)
          if T[j] == k
              T[j] == DELETED
          i = i + 1
      until T[j] == NIL or i == m


As for searching, interestingly enough we don't need to modify it, as long as
`k` is never `DELETED` and `DELETED != NIL`.

    HASH-SEARCH(T, k)
      i = 0
      repeat
          j = h(k, i)
          if T[j] == k
              return j
          i = i + 1
          until T[j] == NIL or i == m
      return NIL
