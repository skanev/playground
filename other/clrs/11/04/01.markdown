Here's a hand-rolled table:

       linear      double
       +------+    +------+
     0 |  22  |    |  22  |
       +------+    +------+
     1 |  88  |    |      |
       +------+    +------+
     2 |      |    |  59  |
       +------+    +------+
     3 |      |    |  17  |
       +------+    +------+
     4 |   4  |    |   4  |
       +------+    +------+
     5 |  15  |    |  15  |
       +------+    +------+
     6 |  28  |    |  28  |
       +------+    +------+
     7 |  17  |    |  88  |
       +------+    +------+
     8 |  59  |    |      |
       +------+    +------+
     9 |  31  |    |  31  |
       +------+    +------+
    10 |  10  |    |  10  |
       +------+    +------+
