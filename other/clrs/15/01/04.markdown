This can be done by sorting all the activities by `(start-time, end-time)` and
run a simulation. We basically move the time forward (or just identify the
interesting times and move through them) and keep track of the currently ongoing
activities. We need enough lecture halls to host he biggest overlap possible
when we process them this way. The decisions can be made greedy because we can
sort the intervals.
