Time for ASCII art!

Least duration won't work because of this:

         *****
    ******* *******

The event on the top row would be selected, but it would be more optimal to
select the two in the second row.

Earliest start time won't work here:

    **********
      **** ****

It would be better to pick the two on the second line, but the one on the firs
line starts first.

Least overlaps is trickiest:

    ******* ********** *******
    **** *****      ***** ****
    *******            *******
    *******            *******

The second event on the top row overlaps with the fewest of the other intervals,
just two. Every other one is overlapping with at least 3 other events. But if we
pick it, we would close the door for selecting the four events on the second
that are the optimal solution.
