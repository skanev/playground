> Prove that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-choice property.

Let $i$ be the item with the biggest $v_i / w_i$ value. Let's also assume that
$W >= w_i$, just to simplify the argument. Let's show that if we have an optimal
solution $S$, we can construct another optimal solution that includes $w_i$ of
the $i$th item.

Let's define $d_i = v_i / w_i$, which is the "value density" of the $i$th item,
and let's the optimal solution be $S = \\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\\}$, where $a_i$
is how much of the item we've picked ($a_i \le w_i$).

Using $S$ we can construct another optimal solution that maximizes $a_m$ where
$m$ is the item with the highest density $d_m$. We can construct another optimal
solution that maximizes the item $m$.

If $a_m < w_m$, then let's have $s = \min(w_m, W) - a_m$ (how much more of $i$
we could have taken). If $s = 0$ then $S$ satisfies the condition and is the
optimal solution we need. Otherwise, let's pick some items $R$ and move some
fractions from them to $i$. That is, we have a quantity $\sum_{j \in R} r_j = s$
that we remove from each item $j \in R$ and put into $i$. This new solution $S'$
will have the following difference with $S$':

$$
  V(S') - V(S) = s d_i - \sum_{j \in R} r_j d_j
$$

We can transform this a bit:

$$
  s d_i - \sum_{j \in R} r_j d_j =
  \sum_{j \in R} r_j d_i - \sum_{j \in R} r_j d_j =
  \sum_{j \in R} r_j (d_i - d_j) \ge
  0
$$

The last part is because $_j \ge 0$ and we picked $i$ so $d_i \ge d_j$ for any
$j$. In fact, unless $d_i = d_j$, $S$ is not an optimal solution.
