**(UNSOLVED?)**. I'm not quite sure about where the problem is here, and it gets
very technical.

At the very least, we could not prove that property 1 holds, because if (or
rather, when) $S$ subsequently loads $x$, and evicts $w \ne z$ (assuming it
still has $z$), it will no longer be the case that both $|D_j| \ge k - 1$ and
$C_{S,j} = D \cup \\{z\\}$ and $C_{S',j} = D \cup \\{ x \\}$. $S'$ either needs
to evict $x$ now, breaking the property, or has to unnecessarily eject $w$ and
now there $|D_j| = k - 2$. Or alternatively loading $z$ in order to make them
equal, but loading it too early.

This breaks the proof going forward, although I haven't tried to "fix" it and
see what else breaks.
