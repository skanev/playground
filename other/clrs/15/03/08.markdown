The hint spells it out. We need to show that it isn't possible to construct a
bijection between inputs and outputs, because the cardinality of the outputs is
smaller than the cardinality of the inputs.

Let's look at files of exactly $l$ bits. There are $2^l$ possible files. Let's
assume we can encode them to a file of $k$ bits where $k < l$. The number of
possible output files is:

$$ \sum_{k=0}^{l-1} 2^k = 2^l - 1 $$

Which is one short. And of course, that's only if we consider the files of
exactly $l$ bits. If we also include the files of $l-1, l-2, \ldots$ bits as
well, they don't have anywhere to go, because we've already taken all the
possible options.
