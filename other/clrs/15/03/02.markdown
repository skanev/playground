If the binary tree is not full, this means that there is a node with a single
child. If we replace with the child we get another prefix-tree that has less
cost (all the children of that node are 1 cheaper), therefore the original
binary tree cannot be optimal.

This would mean, for example, that both `1101..` and `1100..` encode something,
but `111..` does not encode anything. We could just replace all the `110..`
codes with `11..` codes and get a better encoding.
