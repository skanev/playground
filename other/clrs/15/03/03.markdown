This will construct a tree where for each internal node the probability of the
two children will be equal, and one child will be a leaf node, while the other
will be internal and having the same property.

A simple way to think about it is that we will get the following encodings:

    h = 0
    g = 10
    f = 110
    e = 1110
    d = 11110
    c = 111110
    b = 1111110
    a = 1111111

Basically, the optimal solution for Fibonacci frequencies will always look like
this.
