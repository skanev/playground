Two things.

First, since the characters are at most $n$, we can encode them with $\lceil \lg
n \rceil$ bits.

Second, we can do a pre-order traversal of the tree and write what we see. If we
encounter an internal node, we output 0. If we encounter a leaf node, we output
1 and then output the bits of the character. This will uniquely determine the
tree structure, along with each character in it. The remaining $2n - 1$ bits
will be enough because it's a full binary trees.
