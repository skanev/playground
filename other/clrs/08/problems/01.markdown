### Probability labels

There are $n!$ permutations that the algorithm can perform and each
corresponds to one of the $n!$ possible inputs. Each permutation will be a
leaf in this tree and since the inputs are equally likely, the probability of
reaching one will be $1/n!$. If the decision tree has more leaves, they will
be unreachable.

This is an intuitive argument. It's easy to see that it is so if you think
about it, but a formal proof seems tricky to me.

### External path length

If we take a node in the tree, all paths go either through the left or the
right child. Both children have the same paths as the node itself, except that
they are shorter by one. Thus, $D(T) = D(LT) + D(RT) +
\mathrm{LEAVES}(LT) + \mathrm{LEAVES}(RT) = D(LT) + D(RT) + k$.

### Minimal external path length

If we take a tree with $k$ leaves that achieves the minimal external path,
we know from the previous point that:

$$ D(T) = D(LT) + D(RT) + k $$

There are $k - 1$ possible pairs of left-right children and one of them is the
minimum. That is:

$$ d(k) = D(T) = D(LT) + D(RT) + k = \min_{1 \le i \le k-1}\\{d(i) + d(k-i) + k\\} $$

### Minimal value

Let:

$$ \begin{aligned}
      f(i) &= i\lg{i} + (k-i)\lg(k-i) \\\\
     f'(i) &= \lg{i} + 1 - \lg(k-i) - 1 = \lg\frac{i}{k-i} \\\\
     f'(i) = 0 & \Leftrightarrow \lg\frac{i}{k-i} = 0 \Rightarrow i/(k-i) = 1 \Rightarrow i = \frac k 2
   \end{aligned} $$

Since $f'(i)$ is monotonously increasing, $i = k/2$ is a local minimum.

Intuitively said, the minimum is reached when the tree is balanced (as in the
way merge sort halves is decision-tree on each step.

### Average-case time

In $T_A$ there are $n!$ leaves, thus $D(n) > d(k) = \Omega(n!\lg(n!))$. Each
permutation has an equal probability of $1/n!$, thus the expected time to sort
it is:

$$ \frac{\Omega(n!\lg(n!))}{n!} = \Omega(n\lg(n!)) = \Omega(n\lg{n}) $$

### The randomized algorithm

A deterministic algorithm $A$ corresponding to $B$ would be one that has made
its "random" choices in advance. To construct it we just remove the randomized
nodes by replacing them by a child we pick. The new result is a subtree (in
respect to the non-randomized nodes) and its number of choices is less than or
equal to the one of the randomized algorithm. Since any subtree we pick is
$\Omega(n\lg{n})$, this implies that $B$ is $\Omega(n\lg{n})$.
