### The numbers

For the numbers, we can do this:

1. Group the numbers by number of digits and order the groups
2. Radix sort each group

Let's analyze the number of steps. Let $G_i$ be the group of numbers with $i$
digits and $c_i = |G_i|$. Thus:

$$ T(n) = \sum_{i=1}{n}c_i \cdot i = n $$

### The strings

For the strings, we can do this:

1. Groups the strings by length and order the groups
2. Starting $i$ on the maximum length and going down to 1, perform counting
   sort on the $i$th character. Make sure to include only groups that have an
   $i$th character.

If the groups are subsequent subarrays in the original array, we're performing
counting sort on a subarray ending on the last index of the original array.

### The implementation

The C code is a bit clever, but this is an exercise, not a production system.
