The unit circle has area $\pi 1^2 = \pi$. We need to split it in $n$ discs,
each having area $\pi / n$. The radius of such a disc is $\pi(b^2 - a^2)$,
where $b$ is the radius of the outer edge and $a$ is the radius of the inner
edge of the disc.

Let the points $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$ divide the circle in n dics, the
$i$th disc having radiuses $a_i$ and $a_{i-1}$. We know that $a_0 = 0$ and $a_n
= 1$. For any two discs we have:

$$ \pi^2 \pi(a_i^2 - a_{i-1}^2) = \pi(a_j^2 - a_{j-1}^2) = \frac{\pi}{n} \\\\
   \Downarrow \\\\
   a_i^2 - a_{i-1}^2 = a_j^2 - a_{j-1}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \\\\
   \Downarrow \\\\
   a_i^2 = \frac{1}{n} + a_{i-1}^2 $$

We get the following recurrence:

$$ \begin{align}
   a_0 &= 0 \\\\
   a_i &= \sqrt{1/n + a_{i-1}^2}
   \end{align} $$

If we check some small values, we see the following pattern:

$$ \pi n^2 $$

$$ \begin{align}
   a_0 & = 0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt n} \\\\
   a_1 & = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n}} = \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt n} \\\\
   a_2 & = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{2}{n}} = \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt n} \\\\
   & \ldots \\\\
   a_i & = \frac{\sqrt i}{\sqrt n}
   \end{align} $$

The last step is easy to prove by induction. If we assume it for $i \le k$, then:

$$ a_{k+1} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + a_k^2}
           = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{k}{n}}
           = \frac{\sqrt{k+1}}{\sqrt n} $$

Thus, we create buckets for the following intervals:

$$ \bigg[0, \frac{1}{\sqrt n} \bigg),
   \bigg[\frac{1}{\sqrt n}, \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt n}\bigg) \cdots
   \bigg[\frac{\sqrt{n-1}}{\sqrt n}, 1 \bigg] $$

And distribute elements according to their distance. To calculate the bucket
$k$ for a distance $d$ in constant time, just take:

$$ k = \begin{cases}
    \lfloor d^2n \rfloor + 1 & \text{if } d < 1, \\\\
    n & \text{id } d = 1
  \end{cases} $$

...for 1-based buckets.
