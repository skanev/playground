> Let $X$ be a random variable that is equal to the number of heads in two

First let's see what $\E[X]$ is:

$$ \E[X] = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 $$

Next we take $\E[X^2]$:

$$ \E[X^2] = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1.5 $$

Finally $\E^2[X]$:

$$ \E^2[X] = \E[X] \cdot \E[X] = 1 $$
