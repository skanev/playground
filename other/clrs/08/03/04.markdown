We can do so by merging the two algorithms together:

1. We start with a pass that does the first count
2. On the second pass, we start a new `C` array that counts the number for the
   next pass. We do that while moving to `B`
3. Once we reach the final pass, we just need to do another move to `B`

This way we do $d - 1$ passes that both move and count, one pass that just
counts, and another pass that just moves.
