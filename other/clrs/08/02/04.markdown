This is so obvious that I find it hard to prove formally. It's easy to see that
upon entering the loop `C[i]` stores the largest index in the sorted array of an
element with value `i`, because it is the sum of counts of all elements less
than `i` plus the number of elements equal to `i`.

At every step of the loop we copy an element and decrement `C[i]`, maintaining
the invariant.
