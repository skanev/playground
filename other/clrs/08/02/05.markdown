Once you've counted the numbers, you just replicate them a bunch of times in the
original array:

    COUNTING-SORT(A, n, k)
      let C[0:k] be a new array
      for i = 0 to K
        C[i] = 0
      for j = 1 to n
        C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] + 1

      pos = 1
      for i = 0 to k
        while C[i] > 0
          A[pos] = i
          C[i] = C[i] - 1
          pos = pos + 1
