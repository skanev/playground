> Prove that `COUNTING-SORT` is stable.

An informal argument will suffice.

Let's say that two elements at indices $i_1 < i_2$ are equal to each other. In
the sorted array, they take place at indices $j_1 + 1 = j_2$. Since the
`COUNTING-SORT` processes the input array in reverse order, $A[i_2]$ is put in
$B[j_2]$ first and then $A[i_1]$ is put in $B[j_1]$. Since the two elements
preserve their order, the algorithm is stable.
