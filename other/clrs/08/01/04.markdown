**(UNSOLVED)**

I'm not sure how to proceed here, although it feels trivial. This reduces the
number of possible permutations to $3^{n/4} \cdot (3n/4)!$ which is less than
$n!$, but should be asymptotically equal.

The third edition had a more interesting exercise, I'm leaving the solution here
just in case:
