This is somehow tricky. There are $n/k$ subsequences and each can be ordered in
$k!$ ways. This makes a $(k!)^{n/k}$ outputs. We use the same reasoning:

$$ (k!)^{n/k} \le 2^h $$

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

$$ \begin{align}
   h &\ge \lg(k!)^{n/k} \\\\
     &=   (n/k)\lg(k!) \\\\
     &\ge (n/k)(k/2)\lg(k/2) & \text{(ex 8.1.2)}\\\\
     &=   \frac{1}{2}n\lg{k} - \frac{1}{2}n \\\\
     &=   \Omega(n\lg{k})
   \end{align} $$
