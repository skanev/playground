> Rewrite `ENQUEUE` and `DEQUEUE` to detect underflow and overflow of a queue.

I shall go with the pseudo-code version, since I'm too lazy to bother figuring
out how to test it in C.

We need to do a slight modification, since the current version provides no way
to tell whether a queue is empty or full. We should have `Q.head == NIL` when
the queue is empty and `Q.head == Q.tail` when the queue is full. An empty
queue is initializes with `NIL` in its head and `Q.tail = `. We need to update
`Q.head` when a `DEQUEUE` operation causes the queue to become empty.

    ENQUEUE(Q, x)
      if Q.head == Q.tail
          error "Queue overflow"

      Q[Q.tail] = x

      if Q.head == NIL
          Q.head = Q.tail

      if Q.tail == Q.length
          Q.tail = 1
      else
          Q.tail = Q.tail + 1

    DEQUEUE(Q)
      if Q.head == NIL
          error "Queue underflow"

      x = Q[Q.head]

      if Q.head == Q.length
          Q.head = 1
      else
          Q.head = Q.head + 1

      if Q.head == Q.tail
          Q.head = NIL
      return x
