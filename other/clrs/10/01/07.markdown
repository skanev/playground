> Show how to implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze the running time of
> the queue operations.

Let the two stacks be `A` and `B`.

`ENQUEUE` pushes elements on `B`. `DEQUEUE` pops elements from `A`. If `A` is
empty, the contents of `B` are transfered to `A` by popping them out of `B`
and pushing them to `A`. That way they appear in reverse order and are popped
in the original.

A `DEQUEUE` operation can perform in $\Theta(n)$ time, but that will happen
only when `A` is empty. If many `ENQUEUE`s and `DEQUEUE`s are performed, the
total time will be linear to the number of elements, not to the largest length
of the queue.
