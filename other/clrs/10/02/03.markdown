This is a bit trickier than the previous one, but still simple.

* We need to keep track of the last element of the list.
* Whenever we `ENQUEUE`, we should be inserting the element after it and
  marking the new last element of the list.
* Whenever we `DEQUEUE`, we should pop the first element of the list.
* We should check if we're dequeueing the last element of the list, in which
  case we should update the last pointer to nil.
