; SICP exercise 2.02

; Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment
; is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point.
; Define a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment
; that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a
; point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y
; coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors
; x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your
; selectors and constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a
; line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose
; coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your
; procedures, you'll need a way to print points:
;
; (define (print-point p)
;   (newline)
;   (display "(")
;   (display (x-point p))
;   (display ",")
;   (display (y-point p))
;   (display ")"))

(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (x-point point)
  (car point))

(define (y-point point)
  (cdr point))

(define (make-segment start-point end-point)
  (cons start-point end-point))

(define (start-segment segment)
  (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
  (cdr segment))

(define (midpoint-segment segment)
  (let ((start (start-segment segment))
        (end (end-segment segment)))
    (make-point (average (x-point start) (x-point end))
                (average (y-point start) (y-point end)))))

(define (average a b)
  (/ (+ a b)
     2))

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))
