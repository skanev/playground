; The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's
; function:
;
; (define (A x y)
;   (cond ((= y 0) 0)
;         ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
;         ((= y 1) 2)
;         (else (A (- x 1)
;                  (A x (- y 1))))))
;
; What are the values of the following expressions?
;
; (A 1 10)
;
; (A 2 4)
;
; (A 3 3)
;
; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:
;
; (define (f n) (A 0 n))
;
; (define (g n) (A 1 n))
;
; (define (h n) (A 2 n))
;
; (define (k n) (* 5 n n))
;
; Give consice mathematical definition for the functions computed by the procedures f, g and h
; for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n².
